Recent Master of Arts in Statistics graduate seeking opportunities in data science, data engineering, and analytical roles. 

Highly proficient in both **SAS and R programming** with a high interest in finding insight in datasets that leads to actionable results.

From extracting and engineering data from pdf tables and web sources that lead to datasets in which to perform a wide array of Exploratory Data Analysis, the longitudinal aspects in the data process are of high interest to me.   

When I'm not on my computer I'm watching NBA games, discovering new tropical house remixes, and training for my next race.

## üìò Data Projects

1. üèÄ **MAC Basketball Feature Selection Techniques**

 [Rpubs Link](https://rpubs.com/Dresden2013/1060302)

Basketball games in which MAC men's basketball teams participated were analyzed using feature reduction techniques in order to predict results. 

Reduction techniques managed to reduce the dimensionality of the applied data set by more than half in most cases leading to computational time efficiency and a reduction in data complexity.

Results predictions were classified after an 80/20 randomized training/test data split, an 80/20 split was chosen as the most common rule of thumb when splitting data for training purposes.

Logistic regression consistently outperformed KNN classification with lower classified test errors, LOGisitc and KNN were chosen as the most popular classification techniques in data science. 

Utilized paired sample T-Test to compare means of reduced variables in relation to results, paired t-test was chosen due to the two groups belonging to the same population.
