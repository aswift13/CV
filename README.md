Recent Master of Arts in Statistics graduate seeking opportunities in data science, data engineering, and analytical roles. 

Highly proficient in both **SAS and R programming** with a high interest in finding insight in datasets that leads to actionable results.

From extracting and engineering data from pdf tables and web sources that lead to datasets in which to perform a wide array of Exploratory Data Analysis, the longitudinal aspects in the data process are of high interest to me.   

When I'm not on my computer I'm watching NBA games, discovering new tropical house remixes, and training for my next race.
